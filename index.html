      <p>
        Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana,
        children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to
        the day in the week they were born. This is
        a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of
        the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their
        Akan name.
