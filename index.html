                <p>
                  Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana,
                  children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to
                  the day in the week they were born. Here are Ghanian day names. This is
                  a web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of
                  the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their
                  Akan Name.
